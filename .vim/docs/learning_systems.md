# Learning systems for Political Economy

What I want is a system that is more general than Axelrod's PD tournament or Lindgren's evolutionary implementation of it.

I've been thinking about how to have agents create games and propose them to other agents to play with them.

Another possibility is for them to propose contracts. Then between signing the contract and the contract's maturity they can learn how to take appropriate actions, but they don't have to be totally pinned down by the contract. For this to work there needs to be some set of actions that agents can take in any given round and they need to (implicitly) consider how those actions affect their payoffs given the contracts available to them.
